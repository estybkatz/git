# Pic up
This project is a  system of advertising images for sell and viewing them.
It uses HTML, JS and CSS.
In this site we use arrays of objects, and functions working on them. 
We also defined functions using the objects and the arrays, with input from the users.
We defined dynamical arrays of objects, and managed them, as well as managed the places while adding and deleting items.
Also we use validations of multiple types of strings using regex.
